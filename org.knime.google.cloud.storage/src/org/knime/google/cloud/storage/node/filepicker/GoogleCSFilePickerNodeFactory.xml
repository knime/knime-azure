        <intro>
	        This node reads the Google Cloud Storage connection and generates a signed URL that references a storage object. 
	        The URL is only valid for a specific period of time. Upon expiry, 
	        the URL will no longer remain active and an attempt to access the URL will generate an error. 
	        Google Cloud Storage objects do not have to have their permissions set to public in order to access them. 
	        Using the generated signed URL, any KNIME reader can be utilized to directly read the blob without having to fetch the blob locally first.
