    <name>Azure Blob Storage Connector (Labs)</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
        Connects to Azure Blob Storage in order to read/write files in downstream nodes.

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            <p>This node connects to Azure Blob Storage. The resulting output port allows downstream nodes to access
            the Azure Blob Storage data as a file system, e.g. to read or write files and folders,
            or to perform other file system operations (browse/list files, copy, move, ...).
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Path syntax:</b> Paths for Azure Blob Storage are specified with a UNIX-like syntax, /mycontainer/myfolder/myfile. An absolute
            for Azure Blob Storage consists of:
                <ol>
                    <li>A leading slash ("/").</li>
                    <li>Followed by the name of a container ("mycontainer" in the above example), followed by a slash.</li>
                    <li>Followed by the name of an object within the container ("myfolder/myfile" in the above example).</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </intro>
        <tab name="Settings">
	        <option name="Working directory">
	            Specifies the <i>working directory</i> using the path syntax explained above. The working directory must be specified as an absolute path. A working directory allows downstream
	            nodes to access files/folders using <i>relative</i> paths, i.e. paths that do not have a leading slash. If not specified, the default working directory
	            is "/".
	        </option>
	        <option name="Normalize paths">
	            Determines if the path normalization should be applied. Path normalization eliminates redundant components of a path like, e.g. /a/../b/./c" can be normalized to "/b/c".
	            When these redundant components like "../" or "." are part of an existing object, then normalization must be deactivated in order to access them properly.
